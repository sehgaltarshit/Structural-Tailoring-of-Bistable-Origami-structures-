Please refer to  the pdf file, ESEP-G Presentation to get and overview of work, problem statement and my results. 
The other pdf, Program Report and Feedback (G) 2025, contains my work overview, my learnings, and some reviews of my host professor on my work. 
The last one is the python code to do the Abaqus simulation of such waterbomb base structures. This was the code which I wrote to automate the process for multiple simulations. Please change the path of the file in the code if you intend to use it, it is currently written according to my local storage 
The STEP files named "waterbomb_base_60_1" means that the angle of waterbomb base is 60 degree, and the number after 60, here 1, represents the ratio of length to breadth, so in this case this is a square waterbomb base strucutre
